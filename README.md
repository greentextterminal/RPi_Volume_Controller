# RPi Volume Controller
This repo contains the code for the volume controller. The programs are split for testing and experimentation as well as a combined version. The volume control is handled by the PotentiometerVolumeControl file, mute and subsequent LED light control is handled by the MuteAndLightControl file. The final program is the combined integration of these two programs in CombinedVolumeMuteLighsControl.
